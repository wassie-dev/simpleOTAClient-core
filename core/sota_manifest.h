/**
 * @file
 * @brief The signed manifest: proof, from the project's own key, of which
 * build number and which project an image belongs to.
 *
 * The image signature covers the firmware bytes and nothing else, and the
 * server assigns the build number after it was made. So a server that has
 * been taken over could offer an old signed image under a higher number,
 * or another project's image when two projects share a key, and the
 * signature would still verify. The manifest closes that: once the server
 * has said which build an upload became, the SimpleOTA CLI signs these
 * bytes with the same key, on the customer's machine,
 *
 *     SimpleOTA-Manifest-v1\n
 *     <project id: the project's UUID, lowercase with hyphens>\n
 *     <signing key id>\n
 *     <build number, decimal>\n
 *     <sha256 of the image, 64 lowercase hex digits>\n
 *
 * and the server hands the signature out with the offer. The device never
 * parses a signed document. It writes the same lines from what it holds
 * itself (its configured project id, the offer's key id, build number and
 * checksum) and checks the signature over them. The download then has to
 * match that checksum, as it always did.
 *
 * Portable and host-tested (test/host/test_signing.c).
